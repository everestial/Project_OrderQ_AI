# OrderQ AI - Order Processing System

## Project Overview

OrderQ AI is a natural language processing system that converts natural language restaurant orders into structured JSON format. The system uses a fine-tuned T5 model to extract structured information from customer orders.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts free-form order text into structured data
- **Customer Information Extraction**: Identifies customer names and order types
- **Item Parsing**: Extracts item names, quantities, and modifications
- **JSON Output**: Produces well-formatted JSON for downstream processing
- **Robust Post-Processing**: Handles and fixes common model output issues

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: T5-base (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Task**: Sequence-to-sequence generation
- **Training Data**: TSV file with natural language orders and structured targets
- **Input Format**: "extract order: [natural language order]"
- **Output Format**: JSON with order structure

## Data Structure

The system extracts the following information from orders:

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John Smith",
  "order_type": "delivery",
  "total_number_of_different_items": 2,
  "order_items_name": "pizza|diet cokes",
  "order_items_quantity": "2|3",
  "order_items_modifications": "large|extra cheese|",
  "order_notes": null
}
```

## Detailed File Descriptions

### `process_order.py` - Production Order Processing

This is the core production module that handles real-world order processing using a function-based approach. It provides robust interfaces for converting natural language orders into structured JSON and supports file-based batch processing.

**Key Features:**
- **Function-Based Design**: Clean, modular functions for easy integration
- **File I/O Support**: Read orders from text files and save results to TSV format
- **JSON Post-Processing**: Automatic fixing of common model output issues including:
  - Missing curly braces `{}`
  - Malformed patterns and invalid JSON structures
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed error reporting
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple orders efficiently
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for real-world deployment with proper resource management

**Main Functions:**
- `initialize_model(model_path)`: Load the trained model and tokenizer
- `process_order(model, tokenizer, device, order_text)`: Process a single order
- `process_orders_from_file(input_file, output_file, model, tokenizer, device)`: Batch process from file
- `validate_and_fix_json(text)`: Fix malformed JSON outputs

**Usage Example:**
```python
from process_order import initialize_model, process_order

# Initialize once
model, tokenizer, device = initialize_model('./trained_model')

# Process orders
result = process_order(model, tokenizer, device, "Hi, I'm John. I want 2 pizzas for delivery.")
if result['status'] == 'success':
    parsed_result = json.loads(result['result'])
    print(f"Customer: {parsed_result['customer_name']}")
    print(f"Items: {parsed_result['order_items_name']}")
```

**File Processing:**
```python
# Process orders from file
process_orders_from_file('data/orders.txt', 'data/processed_orders.tsv', model, tokenizer, device)
```

## Training Process

1. **Data Loading**: Loads TSV data with proper handling of NaN values and pandas data types
2. **Tokenization**: Prepares input/output pairs for T5 model
3. **Training**: Fine-tunes T5-base for 3 epochs with proper hyperparameters
4. **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model and tokenizer

## Post-Processing

The system includes robust post-processing to handle common model output issues:

- **JSON Formatting**: Adds missing curly braces to incomplete JSON
- **Malformed Patterns**: Fixes issues like `"field": "value": "another_value"`
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles parsing failures

## Usage

### Training a New Model

```bash
python train_tokenizer.py
```

### Processing Orders

```python
from process_order import initialize_model, process_order
import json

# Initialize model once
model, tokenizer, device = initialize_model('./trained_model')

# Process a single order
order_text = "Hello, my name is John Smith. I'd like to order 2 large pizzas with extra cheese and 3 diet cokes please."
result = process_order(model, tokenizer, device, order_text)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

### Processing Orders from File

```python
from process_order import initialize_model, process_orders_from_file

# Initialize model
model, tokenizer, device = initialize_model('./trained_model')

# Process orders from file and save to TSV
